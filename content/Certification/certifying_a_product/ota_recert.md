Placeholder with questions:
- ANN - do you have text around why OTAs and recertification are important
- PETR - does the compatibility matrix cover which ecosystems pick up OTAs from the DCL vs. internal?
- RS - what's the status on the folks looking to integrate OTA into the commissioning process?
